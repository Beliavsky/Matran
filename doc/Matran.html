Matran (pronounced MAY-tran) is a Fortran 95 wrapper that implements
matrix operations and computes matrix decompositions using Lapack and
the Blas.  Although Matran is not based on a formally defined matrix
language, it provides the flavor and convenience of coding in matrix
oriented systems like Matlab, Octave, etc.  By using routines from
Lapack and the Blas, Matran allows the user to obtain the
computational benefits of these packages with minimal fuss and bother.

<p> Detailed information about Matran may be found in the Matran
Writeup (<a
href="ftp://thales.cs.umd.edu/pub/Matran/MatranWriteup.ps">ps</a>, <a
href="ftp://thales.cs.umd.edu/pub/Matran/MatranWriteup.pdf">pdf</a>).
Here we give a general overview of Matran, its organization, and its
capabilities.

<h3>Organization</h3>
<p>Matran consists of a number of Fortran 95 modules, which fall into
five categories.
<dl>
   <dt> The Matran utility module

        <dd> This module contains global parameters, error handlers, and
             utility routines.

   <p><dt> Matrix types
   
        <dd> A Matran matrix type is essentially a storage class for
        matrices.  Currently implemented are the <tt>Rmat</tt> and the
        <tt>Rdiag</tt>.  The <tt>Rmat</tt> represents matrices that
        can be conveniently stored in a rectangular array (whose
        dimensions may be larger than that of the matrix).  The
        <tt>Rdiag</tt> represents diagonal matrices whose diagonal
        elements are stored in a linear array.  Matran can be compiled
        to give a single or double precision package (but not both at
        the same time).

        <p>The <tt>Rmat</tt> has a special <tt>tag</tt> field that
        specifies if the matrix is general, triangular, Hermitian, or
        positive (semi) definite.  Matran uses this field to the most
        efficient way to perform operations with the matrices.  There
        are no packed representations.  For example, the zero elements
        of a triangular matrix are explicitly stored in the
        <tt>Rmat</tt> array.

        <p>The <tt>Rdiag</tt> implements a diagonal matrix with its
        diagonal elements stored in a linear array.

        <p>Although they are not currently implemented, Matran will
        eventually have complex types, <tt>Cmat</tt> and
        <tt>Cdiag</tt>, corresponding to the real types.
              
   <p><dt> Matrix operations

        <dd> Matran overloads old operators and defines new operators
        to compute transposes (<tt>.trp.A</tt>, <tt>.ctp.A</tt>), sums
        (<tt>A+B</tt>, <tt>-A</tt>), and products (<tt>A*B</tt>)of
        matrices.  In addition it defines operators to compute
        quantities like
        <it>A</it><sup><small>-1</small></sup><it>B<it>
        (<tt>A.xiy.B</tt>).  There are also operators for
        concatenating matrices and extracting submatrices.

        <p>These operations are organized into collections of modules
        called suites.  For example, there are two modules in the
        product suite that compute matrix products.  The module
        <tt>RmatProduct_m</tt> implements products between
        <tt>Rmats</tt>, taking due account of the <tt>tag</tt>
        components mentioned above.  The module <tt>RdiagProduct</tt>
        implements products between <tt>Rdiag</tt>s and between
        <tt>Rdiag</tt>s and <tt>Rmat</tt>s.  When the type
        <tt>Cmat</tt> is introduced, the module <tt>CmatProduct_m</tt>
        will be responsible for implementing products between any
        combination of <tt>Rmat</tt>s, <tt>Rdiag</tt>s, and
        <tt>Cmat</tt>s.

   <p><dt> Matrix miscelanea

        <dd> Matran provides a number of useful matrix functions
        (e.g., norms) and constructors (e.g., identity matrices).  It
        also provides a module to pretty print a matrix.
        
   <p><dt> Decompositions

        <dd> Matwrap provides types and constructors for the following
        decompositions: LU with partial pivoting, QR, QR with column
        pivoting, Cholesky, spectral, SVD, real Schur, and the
        eigendecompositon of a general matrix.

        <p> A recurring problem in matrix oriented languages is how to
        prevent the recomputation of matrix decompositions in loops.
        Matran provides features that help the programmer circumvent
        this problem.

</dl>

<h3>Openness</h3>

Modules in Fortran 95 cannot see private parts of other modules.  For
this reason Matran's modules have no private parts at all.  Although
this goes against the grain of object oriented programming, it
actually makes a good deal of sense when it comes to matrix
computations.  The number of uses of matrices (which have been around
for 150 years) is far greater than the number of methods that can be
folded into an object oriented package.  The present arrangements
allow the user to extend the package efficiently by operating directly
on the arrays containing the matrices.  For example, all the powerful
array operations of Fortran 95 are directly available to the Matran
programmer.  The dark side of this flexibility is that the programmer
must exercise discipline in enforcing a number of Matran conventions.

<h3>Memory management</h3>

Matran handles all memory allocation automatically.  It is
conservative and attempts to use available storage wherever possible.
Unfortunately, the storage of matrix types and decompositions declared
in subprograms as well as temporaries passed to subprograms are not
automatically deallocated when the program returns from the
subprogram, and the coder must explicitly deallocate the storage.
However, Matran provides special generic subroutines to make this task
easy.

<p>Matran allows considerable control over the creation of temporary
matrix objects by shadowing matrix operators with subroutine forms.
For example, the statement

<pre>
   C = A + B
</pre>

requires a temporary <tt>Rmat</tt> to hold the intermediate result
<tt>A + B</tt>.  On the other hand the statement

<pre>
   call Plus(C, A, B)
</pre>

accomplishes the same thing with no temporaries.

<p>Matran performs most of its computations by calling appropriate
Lapack and Blas routines, some of which require the user to furnish
working storage.  Ordinarily, this storage is silently allocated and
deallocated by Matran.  But through optional arguments, the coder can
furnish the storage explicitly, thus reducing calls to the allocator.

Matran is at a point where it can perform useful computations (see the
last section of the Matran Writeup (<a
href="ftp://thales.cs.umd.edu/pub/Matran/MatranWriteup.ps">ps</a>, <a
href="ftp://thales.cs.umd.edu/pub/Matran/MatranWriteup.pdf">pdf</a> for
an example), which is why it is being distributed.  However, it can
certainly be improved, and a second purpose of the distribution is to
get feedback before Matran gets so large it is hard to change.  Please
send comments and suggestions to me at <a
href="mailto:stewart@cs.umd.edu"> stewart@cs.umd.edu</a>


There are three areas in which Matran will likely change.
<ul>

   <li> The addition of types and operations for complex matrices.

   <li> The expansion of the matrix miscelanea class of modules.

   <li> The replacement of pointer arrays with allocatable arrays.
   This will happen when the allocatable array extensions to Fortran
   95 are widely and correctly implemented.

</ul>

<h3> Downloading </h3>

Matran is available over the web at
<pre>
   <a href="ftp://thales.cs.umd.edu/pub/Matran">ftp://thales.cs.umd.edu/pub/Matran</a>
</pre>
This directory contains the following files.
<pre>
   README             Please do!
   Matran.html        This document
   MatranWriteup.ps    The postscript documentation
   MatranWriteup.pdf   The pdf documentation
   Matran.tar         The whole shebang
</pre>


<p>Download Matran.tar to a suitable directory and execute
<pre>
   tar -xf Matran.tar
</pre>
This will create a directory <tt>Matran</tt> with the following
contents.
<pre>
   README
   Doc
   Matran
</pre>
Doc is a directory containing the Matran writup.  The directory
<tt>Matran</tt> contains the goodies.

<h3>Installation</h3>

Installation consists of creating an archive of Matran object code.
In principle this is easy to do.  Go to the <tt>Matran</tt> directory and
in the <tt>Makefile</tt> edit the lines

<pre>
   FC = f95

   .f95.o :
           $(FC) -c -fpp $<
</pre>

to invoke your Fortran 95 compiler with the Fortran preprocessor.
(Note the initial spaces in the second line represent a tab
character.)  Then enter

<pre>
   make all
</pre>

followed by

<pre>
   make arch
</pre>

This will produce a file <tt>Matran.a</tt>, which you can move to
wherever you store your library files.

To get a single precision version of Matran, change the <tt>make all</tt>
command to

<pre>
   make all PREC=sngl
</pre>

<p>To use Matran, you must not only link your program to
<tt>Matran.a</tt> but to Lapack and the Blas.  If these routines are
already installed on your system, use the standard linking syntax for
your compiler-loader.  If not, you may obtain them from

<pre>
   www.netlib.org
</pre>

You will need the real codes of the appropriate precision.  The code
is not difficult to compile and collect into a library.  However, the
compiler specified in the Lapack make file is Fortran 77, and it may
be necessary to change it to Fortran 95 for compatibility with Matran.
Note that the Blas you obtain from netlib are reference code and are
not optimized for any particular machine.

<p>Some compilers are fussy about the suffixes they will accept.  For
example some Fortran 95 compilers accept only the suffix <tt>F90</tt>.
The Makefile contains a target <tt>chsuf</tt> that automates the
tedious procedure of changing suffixes on unix machines with
<tt>sed</tt>.  Edit the command

<pre>
   ls -d *.s1 | sed 's/\(.*\)\.s1$$/mv & \1.s2/' | sh
</pre>

to replace <tt>s1</tt> with the old suffix and <tt>s2</tt> with
the new one, and then enter

<pre>
   make chsuf
</pre>


<p> Although Matran has been tested on a number of compilers, it has
been impossible to cover the field.  For this reason, the rough code
used to debug the modules of Matran are included.  Each debugging
program is named after the module it tests; e.g., <tt>RmatDebug</tt>
for the module <tt>Rmat_m</tt>.  The line

<pre> LIB = lapack.a blas.a </pre>

in Makefile must be edited to link to Lapack and the Blas on your
system.  The corresponding Makefile target is <tt>rmatdebug</tt>.
Please understand that these uncommented programs do not represent
exhaustive tests of the modules; they were written to bootstrap
Matran, not establish its correctnesss.  To aid you in deciphering
these programs, representative output is contained in the
<tt>.out</tt> files (e.g., <tt>Rmat.out</tt> for <tt>Rmat_m</tt>).  If
you enounter errors or problems please report them to <a
href="mailto:stewart@cs.umd.edu"> stewart@cs.umd.edu</a>.
